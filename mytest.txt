2. How will you check container logs?
Ans : #docker  logs   ContainerName / ContainerID 

3. What is the method for creating a Docker container?
Ans : Step 1: Create a Base Container. Let's get started by creating a running container.
           Step 2: Inspect Images.
           Step 3: Inspect Containers.
           Step 4: Start the Container.
           Step 5: Modify the Running Container.
           Step 6: Create an Image From a Container.
           Step 7: Tag the Image.
           Step 8: Create Images With Tags.
          Step 9: Delete the Original Container.
          Step 10: Look at Running Containers.

4. Suppose you have 3 containers running and out of these, you wish to access one of them. How do you access a running container?
Ans : Use docker ps to get the name of the existing container.
           Use the command docker exec -it <container name> /bin/bash to get a bash shell in the container.
           Generically, use docker exec -it <container name> <command> to execute whatever command you specify in the container.

5. Explain Dockerfile commands.
Ans :  FROM creates a layer from the  Docker image.
            COPY adds files from your Docker client’s current directory.
            RUN builds your application.
            CMD specifies what command to run within the container.
            ADD Copies new files, directories, or remote file URLs from <SOURCE> and adds them to the filesystem of the image at the path <DESTINATION>.
            ENV instruction sets the environment variable <key> to the value <value>.
            MAINTAINER instruction allows you to set the Author field of the generated images.



AWS :

1. Write a command to upload any file to s3 bucket.
Ans : $aws   s3   cp  <file name>  s3://<bucket name>

2. List AWS services that you worked on. Explain in brief.
Ans : I have used S3  service to store  the objects like website, images , doccuments etc. I have used EC2 service to launch the different servers as 
           per requirement. It can be web Server, database server. all this servers are associated with the VPC. VPC is used to create a customize network.
           It can have different subnets like public and private, IGW , NAT, Route Tables etc. now I have used ELB to distribute the traffic across different
           servers and balance them. With ELB i used AutoScaling to scale up and Scale down the running instances as per the incomming traffic from 
           ELB. The Cloudwatch is used to monitor the healthcheck of the instance by setting the throughput limit. If it exceeds the the mail will be sent by
           using SNS service. I have used RDS for storing the data into mysql database. I used EFS to share the file between two different public instances.
           at last, I used Route53 to register the DNS and to convert the IP address to DNS.  

3. How will you fix below error:
Ans : #chmod 400 keypair.pem         and try again

4.How can you convert a public subnet to private subnet?
Ans : Yes , By removing IGW from its route table.

5.Is it possible to reduce a ebs volume?
Ans : No, if it is already attched and running.

6.Which of the following is not an option in security groups?
Ans : List  of  Users



GIT : 

1. What is the function of ‘GIT PUSH’ in GIT?
Ans:  The git push command allows you to send (or push) the commits from your local branch in your local Git repository to the remote repository.
           To be able to push to your remote repository, you must ensure that all your changes to the local repository are committed.
           This command’s syntax is as follows :  #git push <repo name> <branch name>

2. What is the purpose of branching in GIT? Write a command to create a new branch.
Ans : In general term, the main purpose of branching (a VCS - Version Control System - feature) is to achieve code isolation.
            You have at least one branch, which can be enough for sequential development, and is used for many tasks being recording (committed) 
            on that same unique branch.  
             The following command is for creating a new branch :
             #git  branch <branch name>

3. Write down the steps to push your code on specific branch.
Ans : Step 1 : Firstly, we have to add the code/file from local computer the staging area. for that following command is used :
                            #git  add  <file name> 
           
            Step 2 : Then, Commits your code from staging area to local repository. for that following command is used :
                            #git  commit   -m   "message"
           
            Step 3 : Then, To push the code from local repo to remote repo to specific branch we use following command : 
                            #git  push  <remote name >  <branch name>




JENKINS : 

1. What Are The Most Useful Plugins In Jenkins?
Ans : 1. Build Flow 
            2. Build Monitor
            3. Build Name Setter
            4. Build Pipeline

2. How to restart jenkins from UI?
Ans : I didn't used UI to restart jenkins. Instead I used CLI to restart.
           to restart the jenkins using CLI by following commands :
           
For restarting the Jenkins You could use:

  #<jenkins url>/safeRestart              :- It which allows all running jobs to complete. New jobs will remain in the queue to run after the restart is complete.

  #<jenkins_url>/restart                       :- It will forces a restart without waiting for builds to complete  .
